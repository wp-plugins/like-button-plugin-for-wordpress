Adds a Shortcode [like] which inserts the code for your Like-Button-Plugin-For-Wordpress.You can add it where ever you want. Also a little Like-Button widget is then available. This widget includes a little Like-Button-Generator to make it easier for you to get a Like-Button to your sidebar.

== Description ==

Adds a Shortcode `[like]` which inserts the code for your Facebook-Like-Button. You can create a like-Button with the FB-LB-Generator on the settings-page. After that it is possible to create some Open-Graph-Protocol-Meta-Tags which will be written in the <head>-section. Also the JavaSDK will be used for your Buttons. But only if you enter a valid Facebook-AppID into the AppID-Box.

Now you can put the shortcode `[like]` where ever you want to insert the Facebook-Like-Button.

There is also a new Widget available. Go to the Widget-Page and add the Facebook-Like-Button-Generator to your sidebar. Enter all your information into the FB-LB-Generator - that's it.
